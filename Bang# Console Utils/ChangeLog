	* AssemblyInfo.cs: 

	* ConsoleUtils.cs: When writing backspace to the console we
	now write a space as well, so that the deleted character gets
	really deleted on a Windows console. Fixes issue 2.
	An odd variable name '@add' renamed to 'addition' (It was
	'add' originally but since it is a keyword, MonoDevelop seems
	to have renamed it to '@add').
