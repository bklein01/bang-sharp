	* AssemblyInfo.cs:
	  

	* TcpClientChannel.cs:
	  The client channel's connection pool should actually be
	  separated between instances. It is strongly recommended to
	  use only one instance of TcpClientChannel anyway.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs:
	  

	* TcpClientChannel.cs:
	  Use a separate TcpConnectionPool for the client channel.

	* TcpConnectionPool.cs:
	  TcpConnectionPool has no longer a global instance.

	* TcpClientSinkProvider.cs:
	  Use connection pool provided in the contstructor.

	* TcpConnection.cs:
	  Close writer before reader to avoid flushing buffer after
	  the network stream is disposed.

	* TcpServerChannel.cs:
	  Use separate TcpConnectionPool for each instance.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs:
	  

	* TcpConnection.cs:
	  Use System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem() instead
	  of [delegate].BeginInvoke() for better performance.

	* System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.TwoWayTcp.csproj:

	* TcpClientChannel.cs: Moved ChannelDataStore's ChannelUris
	initialization to its constructor. Fixes issue 4.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs:
	* TcpServerSink.cs:
	* TcpConnectionPool.cs: 

	* TcpConnection.cs: Renamed TcpConnection.ThisID to
	TcpConnection.ThisMachineID (see also other files).
	Renamed TcpConnection.ID to TcpConnection.MachineID (see also
	other files).
	Renamed TcpConnection.ConnectionID to TcpConnection.ID (see
	also other files).

	* TcpServerChannel.cs: Moved ChannelDataStore's ChannelUris
	initialization to its constructor. Fixes issue 4.
	Removed 'host:port' URI from channel URIs since it is not
	needed in most scenarios.

	* System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.TwoWayTcp.csproj: These are
	custom .NET remoting TCP channels I have written for this
	project. They support two-way communication through a single
	connection so they can work through firewalls.
