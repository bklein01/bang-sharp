	* TcpClientChannel.cs: Moved ChannelDataStore's ChannelUris
	initialization to its constructor. Fixes issue 4.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs:
	* TcpServerSink.cs:
	* TcpConnectionPool.cs: 

	* TcpConnection.cs: Renamed TcpConnection.ThisID to
	TcpConnection.ThisMachineID (see also other files).
	Renamed TcpConnection.ID to TcpConnection.MachineID (see also
	other files).
	Renamed TcpConnection.ConnectionID to TcpConnection.ID (see
	also other files).

	connection so they can work through firewalls.
